# TODO

- pi
  - update python version in docker for room pi
  - test pi with no / wrong sensors, pi check that with nothing conneted or connected wrong it stil works
  - button add buffer to not send multiple messages if
  - send welkome message for display
- build aggregations and context information
- build planing AI
- send notes of lecture

## Meeting 01.07

- [x] Communication gateway -> backend (MQTT)
- [x] Communication backend->gateway (MQTT)
- [x] Making motor work
- [ ] Gateway
  - [X] (Simon) sensor dictionary send in utf 8
  - [X] (Simon) send bool actuator is off or on in gateway info
  - [ ] (Simon) send after actuator change
  - [ ] (Simon) disable sensors ?
  - [ ] (Simon) update random number generator manual list
  - [X] bug when broker not connected ?bug no longer apeares
  - [X] ardoino sensor return prefix needs to be removed
  - [X] send ardoino values not 0 to mqtt broker

- [ ] AI Planning
  - [x] Overarching Goals
  - [ ] (Simon) Conversion of DB values to context to inital state
  - [ ] (Simon) Activity recognition
  - [x] First attempts at lecture implementation
  - [X] (Simon) plan cleaning and do not plan cleaning toggle
  - [ ] (Simon) mapping in pddl a -> s
  - [ ] (Simon) individual sensor goals
  - [ ] (Simon) room positiones
  - [ ] (Maximilian, Simon) Sensor aggregation

- [ ] Frontend
 - [ ] actuators off or on
 - [ ] set actuator value from frontend

- [ ] backend
  - [ ] Needed Backend Endpoints
  - [ ] (Maximilian) provide actuator active/inactive value (need value from frontend)
  - [x] (Maximilian) Set room occupancy endpoint
  - [x] (Maximilian) Get Config values
  - [x] (Maximilian) Set Config values
  - [ ] (Maximilian) Start AI Planning for list of rooms (check with database values and thresholds to create problem)
  - [x] Endpoint to change any actuator value
  - [x] (Maximilian) Add lastest values as normal and simplified value to list_devices_in_room
  - [ ] (Maximilian) (optional) Endpoint to provide values and simplified values across a certain timespan
  - [ ] (Maximilian) Endpoint that provides the plan
  - [ ] convert sensor values to high ok low


- [x] Simulation
  - [x] Decide on simulator (needs to provide data via MQTT)

- [] Bugs 
  - [ ] (Simon, Maximilian) Bug: "Â°C", degree Symbol not being parsed correctly in mqtt incoming message -> May need to be parsed on the frontend -> solvet on gateway?
